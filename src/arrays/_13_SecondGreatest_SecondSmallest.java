    create a public static method which will take an int array, find the max, second max and min, second min
    from that array then print them out.

    Hint: Find the max and min FIRST.

    Note: Do it with sort and without sort.

    Example:
       Array -> int[] numbers = {2, 3, 7, 1, 1, 7};

    Output:
        max = 7
        second max = 3
        min = 1
        second min= 2
